						<strong>Ege</strong> is the "tech guy." After working in the software industry for six years, he decided that corporate life wasn't for him. Having always been a fitness buff, he decided to use his technical skills to make it easier for people to become stronger and more flexible. In his spare time, he enjoys biking, rock climbing, reading, coding, and collecting cat pictures on the Internet.

				<h2>We are a revolutionary new yoga company.</h2>
				<p>These days, most yoga classes are offered at studios. While packing classes with yogis is good for the studio owner, most people find it difficult to concentrate and relax in a crowded setting. On top of this, many people desire personal attention from the instructor, which can be difficult when there are thirty other people in the class!</p>

				<p>Add to this the difficulty of finding classes that fit one's busy schedule -- hey, we live in LA after all! -- and well, don't you wish yoga instructors could just come to you instead, and do so at a time of your choosing?</p><br />
